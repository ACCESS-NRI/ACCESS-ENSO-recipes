# ACCESS Evaluation Recipes

A community collection of notebooks and ESMValTool workflows for evaluating ACCESS and other climate models. The collection began with the [CLIVAR ENSO metrics](https://doi.org/10.1175/BAMS-D-19-0337.1) and now includes the Indian Ocean Dipole, MJO/BSISO, ocean diagnostics, examples, and training material. Most notebooks use [ESMValCore](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/projects/ESMValCore/en/stable/) to discover, load, and preprocess climate data.

**Browse the catalogue:** the static gallery in [`web/`](web/) can be built locally with `python -m pip install -r requirements-site.txt` followed by `python scripts/build_site.py`. After this branch is merged, the GitHub Pages workflow will publish searchable cards, model and science filters, and saved-output previews. The model spotlight features ACCESS-ESM1.5, ACCESS-ESM1.6, ACCESS-OM2, ACCESS-OM3, ACCESS-ESM3, and ACCESS-CM3. Counts reflect recipes with an explicit model input or comparison, so a model without tagged recipes may still be usable with a general method. Previews illustrate a notebook; they do not establish that its data or environment is current.

## Find a recipe

The repository is organised first by purpose, then by science subject. The gallery's subject, realm, tool, and model filters come from catalogue metadata rather than folder names.

The [catalogue metadata](catalog/recipes.yml) describes all 91 notebooks and eight ESMValTool YAML recipes. It is the source for the gallery. The `catalog/legacy-paths.json` file maps files from the former `ACCESS-ENSO-recipes` layout to their new locations.

## Run a notebook

Clone this repository on NCI Gadi, open an ARE JupyterLab session, and choose a notebook from the catalogue. The data collections and compute resources needed vary by recipe. See [running recipes](docs/running.md) for setup guidance, and read the first cells of each notebook before running it.

```bash
module use /g/data/xp65/public/modules
module load conda/analysis3
git clone https://github.com/ACCESS-NRI/ACCESS-Evaluation-recipes.git
cd ACCESS-Evaluation-recipes
```

For ESMValTool YAML workflows with local diagnostic scripts, first generate machine-specific copies as described in the [ENSO ESMValTool guide](recipes/enso/esmvaltool/README.md).

## Contribute

New notebooks and YAML workflows belong in the relevant subject folder. Add a record to [the catalogue](catalog/README.md), then run `python scripts/build_site.py --check`. Use a pull request so the scientific method, data requirements, preview, and metadata can be reviewed together. [Notebook review guidance](docs/github_notebooks.md) is available for contributors.

## Provenance and citation

This project grows from ACCESS-ENSO-recipes, whose releases have a [Zenodo record](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14168217). Refer to that record when citing an earlier release. The existing GitHub repository was renamed to preserve its history and community. Check the Zenodo connection before the first release under the broader name. The original authorship remains in the notebook history and `.zenodo.json`.
